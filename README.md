<h2>Algoweb notes</h2>
This repository is collecting all of the knowledge from the Algoritmica per il Web course held in UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano by professor Sebastiano Vigna.

The project is still work in progrss and needs some very important tune ups, especially when it comes to checking that the algebra is sound. If you have spotted any errors along the way or you want to propose any modifications just look at the next section.

To get the compiled source code you should just clone this repository to your machine, head in the directory (./Algoweb) and do a run of latexmk like so:
```
$ latexmk main.tex
```

<h2>Corrections and proposals</h2>
I am providing the above code in pdf form as a first version of the corrected materials, since the corrections were made by me and, to this day, I am not half sure of some of them, I invite anyone spotting problems to open a pull request, or contact me via the issue system here on github or just via an email to <a href="mailto:alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it">alessandro.biagiotti@studenti.unimi.it</a>.

Take anything with a grain of salt!
